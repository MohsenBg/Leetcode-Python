### General Explanation for Search Insert Position Solution

The **Search Insert Position** problem requires determining the index at which a target value should be inserted into a sorted list. If the target is already in the list, the index of the target should be returned.

#### Approach: Binary Search

Your solution uses the **binary search** technique, which is the most efficient method for solving this problem when the list is sorted.

1. **Two Pointers**:
   - `left_pointer` starts at the beginning of the array (`0`).
   - `right_pointer` starts at the end of the array (`len(nums) - 1`).

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - A middle index (`mid`) is calculated as the average of `left_pointer` and `right_pointer`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is equal to the `target`, return `mid` as the index of the target.
   - If `target` is greater than `nums[mid]`, it means the target is in the right half of the array, so move the `left_pointer` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `target` is less than `nums[mid]`, the target is in the left half of the array, so move the `right_pointer` to `mid - 1`.

3. **When the Target is Not Found**:
   - The loop terminates when `left_pointer` exceeds `right_pointer`.
   - At this point, `right_pointer + 1` gives the correct index where the target should be inserted, as it represents the smallest index where the target could fit in the sorted order.

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the list. Binary search operates by halving the search range on each iteration, leading to logarithmic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for the pointers (`left_pointer`, `right_pointer`) and the `mid` index.

### Summary

This solution efficiently uses binary search to find the target's position or insertion point in O(log n) time, which is optimal for this problem when working with sorted arrays.
