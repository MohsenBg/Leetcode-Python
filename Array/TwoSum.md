## Explanation of the Two Sum Solution

### General Explanation for Solving the Two Sum Problem

The **Two Sum** problem involves finding two numbers in a list that add up to a given target. Here's how we solve it efficiently:

1. **Identify the Required Complement**:
   - For each number in the list, calculate the **complement**, which is the number needed to reach the target sum. This complement is simply `target - current number`.

2. **Use a Hash Map for Fast Lookups**:
   - Instead of checking every possible pair of numbers (which would be slow), we use a hash map (or dictionary) to store numbers we’ve already encountered, along with their indices.
   - The hash map allows us to quickly check if the complement of the current number exists, as hash map lookups take constant time on average (O(1)).

3. **Iterate Once**:
   - As we go through the list of numbers:
     - We check if the complement of the current number is already in the hash map.
     - If it is, then we’ve found a pair that adds up to the target, and we can return their indices.
     - If not, we add the current number and its index to the hash map for future lookups.

4. **Early Termination**:
   - Once we find a pair of numbers that sum to the target, we return their indices and stop the iteration. This ensures we avoid unnecessary work.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - This approach is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the list (O(n) time complexity), and it uses extra space for the hash map (O(n) space complexity). This is optimal for solving the problem without a brute force approach.

By leveraging a hash map and processing the list in one pass, we achieve an optimal solution to the problem, avoiding the inefficiencies of nested loops.


### Python Explanation for Solving the Two Sum Problem

1. **Initialize a Dictionary**:
    - We use a dictionary called `values` to store the numbers from the `nums` list as keys, and their corresponding indices as values.
    - This allows for fast lookups with O(1) average time complexity, thanks to the hashing mechanism of the dictionary.

2. **Iterate Over the List**:
    - We loop through each element in the `nums` list using a `for` loop:
    ```python
    for i in range(len(nums)):
    ```

3. **Calculate the Complement**:
    - For each element `nums[i]`, we compute the **complement** as `target - nums[i]`. This is the value we need to find in the dictionary in order to satisfy the equation:
    ```python
    complement = target - nums[i]
    ```

4. **Check for the Complement**:
    - We check if this complement exists in the dictionary `values`. If it does, this means we have already encountered a number such that when added to `nums[i]`, it equals the target.
    - If found, we return the indices of the complement (which is stored in `values`) and the current index `i`:
    ```python
    if complement in values:
        return [values[complement], i]
    ```

5. **Store the Current Value**:
    - If the complement is not found, we store the current number `nums[i]` in the dictionary `values`, using its index `i` as the value:
    ```python
    values[nums[i]] = i
    ```

6. **Return an Empty List**:
    - If no valid pair is found that adds up to the target (though the problem guarantees one solution), the function returns an empty list:
    ```python
    return []
    ```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input list `nums`. We only iterate over the list once, and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since the dictionary can store up to `n` elements in the worst case.
