### General Explanation for Remove Element Solution

The **Remove Element** problem requires removing all instances of a specified value from a list in place and returning the new length of the modified list.

#### Problem Understanding

1. **Input**: A list of integers `nums` and an integer `val`.
2. **Output**: The length of the list after removing all occurrences of `val`, with the elements in the list shifted appropriately.

#### Key Observations

- The order of elements after removal does not need to be preserved.
- Since we are modifying the list in place, we want to minimize unnecessary shifts or extra space.

#### Approach

This solution uses the **two-pointer technique**:

1. **Two Pointers**:
   - **`left_pointer`**: Starts from the left end of the list and iterates over it to examine each element.
   - **`right_pointer`**: Starts from the right end of the list and is used to replace elements that match the target value (`val`).

2. **In-Place Modification**:
   - If the element at `left_pointer` is equal to `val`, it is "removed" by swapping it with the element at `right_pointer`.
   - After the swap, `right_pointer` is decremented to effectively shrink the list by one.
   - If the element at `left_pointer` is not equal to `val`, the pointer moves forward to check the next element.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `left_pointer` exceeds `right_pointer`, indicating that all instances of `val` have been removed.
   - The function returns `right_pointer + 1`, representing the length of the modified list.

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the list. Each element is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are modifying the list in place with a fixed amount of extra memory.

### Summary

By using the two-pointer technique, this solution efficiently removes all instances of a given value in a single pass through the list, modifying the list in place without needing additional space.
